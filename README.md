🛒 Customer Behaviour Analysis Project
📌 Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer shopping patterns to drive data-informed business decisions. The workflow spans the entire data lifecycle: from Python-based data engineering and SQL-driven business intelligence to interactive Power BI storytelling. The goal is to identify high-value customer segments, evaluate discount effectiveness, and optimize subscription strategies.


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Data Cleaning & EDA: 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy).


Database Management: 🗄️ MySQL.


Data Visualization: 📊 Power BI.

Presentation: 🪄 Gamma (AI-powered storytelling).


Environment: 📓 Jupyter Notebook.

⚙️ Project Workflow
1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
The raw data was processed in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure it was "analysis-ready":


Missing Values: Handled null entries in Review Rating by imputing the median rating specific to each product category.


Feature Engineering: * Created an age_group column using deciles to segment customers into Young Adult, Adult, Middle-aged, and Senior categories.

Mapped frequency_of_purchases (e.g., Weekly, Monthly) to numerical purchase_frequency_days for trend analysis.


Optimization: Identified that promo_code_used and discount_applied were identical, allowing for the removal of redundant columns to streamline the dataset.

2. 🔍 Relational Database Analysis (SQL)
The cleaned data was queried in MySQL to extract deep business insights:


Revenue Analysis: Calculated total revenue generated by gender and age group demographics.


Performance Metrics: Identified the top 5 products with the highest average review ratings.


Customer Segmentation: Used CASE statements to categorize customers as New, Returning, or Loyal based on their previous purchase history.


Shipping & Subscriptions: Compared average spend between Standard vs. Express shipping and Subscribers vs. Non-subscribers.

3. 🎨 Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
A professional dashboard was built to turn raw queries into visual stories:


Sales Performance: Real-time tracking of total revenue and average purchase amounts.


Product Insights: Ranking of the top 3 most purchased products within every category using window functions.


Behavioral Trends: Correlation analysis between discount usage and high-spend behavior.

🚀 Key Results & Insights

Loyalty Value: "Loyal" customers (those with high previous purchase counts) were identified as the primary drivers of consistent revenue.


Subscription Impact: Analysis revealed whether repeat buyers (more than 5 purchases) are likely to convert to the subscription model.


Shipping Optimization: Average spend was compared across shipping types to determine if faster shipping correlates with higher order values.

📂 How to Run

Clean the Data: Run the customer_behavior_cleaning.ipynb notebook to process the raw CSV.


Initialize SQL: * Create the customer_behaviour database.

Import the cleaned data and execute customerBehaviourAnalysis.sql for metric extraction.


Explore Visuals: Open the Customer_Behavior_Analysis_Dashboard.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
